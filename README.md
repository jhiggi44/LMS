# Learning Management System

A learning management system I created while I was a student in the master's of software development program at the university of utah. This was part of a database course, where I learned about database design, SQL queries, and much more. Using the MVC pattern, I created this LMS in C# and used LINQ in my controllers to construct my queries. Have a look at the code!
